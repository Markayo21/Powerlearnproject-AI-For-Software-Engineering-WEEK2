# Powerlearnproject-AI-For-Software-Engineering-WEEK2# 📊 SDG 3: Vaccine Coverage Prediction in Kenya

## 🎯 Goal
This project supports **Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3): Good Health and Well-being** by forecasting vaccination coverage trends in Kenya. It focuses on **Measles (MCV1, MCV2)** and **Polio** vaccines using machine learning. The goal is to highlight gaps in immunization and inform data-driven public health interventions.

- ✅ Focus on **MCV1**, **MCV2**, and **Polio**

---

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Python
- `Pandas` – data manipulation  
- `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn` – visualization  
- `Scikit-learn` – machine learning  
- `Jupyter Notebook` – development environment

---

## 🔮 Prediction Highlights

- **Model Metrics**  
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): ~7.14  
  - R² Score: ~0.78  

- **Predicted 2025 Coverage**  
  - MCV1: ~87%  
  - MCV2: ~82%  
  - Polio: ~89%
